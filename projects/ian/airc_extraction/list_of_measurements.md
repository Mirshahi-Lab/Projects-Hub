# AI Rad Companion Output

1. Pulmonary Density
    - Total Volume of Lungs and Lung Subsections
    - Measures high opacity regions
    - "Opacity Score" as a stand in for health of lung (I think?)
    - Medical range for size and opacity (green = ok, yellow = caution, red = bad)
2. Lung Parenchyma Measurement
    - Segments the parenchyma in the lobes of the lung
    - Gives the output as a percentage of the total volume (I think?)
3. Lung Lesions
    - Segments lesions found within lungs
    - describes location, diameter, and volume of lesions
4. Cardio
   - Total Heart Volume (mL)
   - Total Coronary Artery Calcification (mm^3)
5. Thoracic Aorta
   - 9 diameter measurements along the distance of the thoracic aorta
   - Always in the same locations for reproducibility
6. Spine
   - Anterior, posterior, and medial length of each vertebrae
   - Average attenuation (hounsfield unit) of each vertebrae
   - Medical range for size and attenuation (green = ok, yellow = caution, red = bad)
